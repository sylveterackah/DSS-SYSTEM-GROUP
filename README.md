## 🔑 Key Features

### 1. Four-Level Ordinal Risk Classification
- **Low** (Green): Minimal risk, standard monitoring
- **Medium** (Yellow): Moderate risk, increased attention
- **High** (Orange): Significant risk, mitigation required
- **Critical** (Red): Severe risk, immediate action needed

### 2. Ordinal-Aware Evaluation
- **Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK)**: Measures agreement accounting for ordinal nature
- **Within-One Accuracy**: Allows predictions within one ordinal level
- **Macro F1**: Balanced performance across classes

### 3. Explainable AI
- **SHAP Values**: Feature importance for individual predictions (available for Random Forest and XGBoost models only)
- **Natural Language Narratives**: Plain-English explanations for tree-based model predictions (Random Forest and XGBoost)
- **Waterfall Plots**: Visual explanation of feature contributions (Random Forest and XGBoost)
- **Note**: For Multinomial Logistic Regression, Ordinal Logistic Regression, SVM, and KNN models, the system provides predictions and probabilities without feature attribution explanations

## 📈 Model Performance

### How to Determine the Best Model

For ordinal classification problems (Low, Medium, High, Critical), **no single metric tells the whole story**. Use this decision framework:

**Primary Metric: QWK (Quadratic Weighted Kappa)**
- **Why**: The gold standard for ordinal problems - accounts for the ordered nature of classes
- **Interpretation**: Measures agreement between predictions and actual values, weighted by ordinal distance
- **Higher is better**: 0.68+ is good, 0.70+ is excellent

**Secondary Metric: Within-One Accuracy**
- **Why**: More lenient for ordinal problems - counts predictions within ±1 level as correct
- **Interpretation**: Shows how often the model is "close enough" for practical decision-making
- **Higher is better**: 0.90+ indicates the model rarely makes severe errors

**Tertiary Metric: Exact-Match Accuracy**
- **Why**: Traditional accuracy - only counts exact matches
- **Interpretation**: Strict measure of perfect predictions
- **Higher is better**: But less informative for ordinal problems

**Support Metric: Macro F2**
- **Why**: Prioritizes recall over precision - critical for risk detection where missing high-risk cases is costly
- **Interpretation**: F-beta score with β=2, weighting recall twice as heavily as precision
- **Formula**: F₂ = (1 + 2²) × (precision × recall) / (2² × precision + recall) = 5 × (precision × recall) / (4 × precision + recall)
- **Higher is better**: 0.50+ indicates reasonable balance with emphasis on catching high-risk cases

### Model Selection Recommendation

**Best Overall Model: Ordinal Logistic Regression**
- Highest QWK (0.6829 → 68.29%) - best ordinal agreement
- Highest Within-One Accuracy (0.9617 → 96.17%) - rarely makes severe errors
- Strong Macro F2 (0.5082 → 50.82%) - prioritizes capturing high-risk cases
- **Use for**: Production deployment when ordinal accuracy and risk detection matter most

**Alternative: Random Forest**
- Highest Exact-Match Accuracy (0.5217 → 52.17%) - best strict accuracy
- Strong Within-One Accuracy (0.9483 → 94.83%) - good ordinal performance
- Good Macro F2 (0.5081 → 50.81%) - prioritizes capturing high-risk cases
- **Use for**: When exact matches are critical and robust ensemble performance is desired

**Highest Macro F2: Logistic Regression**
- Highest Macro F2 (0.5241 → 52.41%) - best at prioritizing recall for risk detection
- Strong QWK (0.6604 → 66.04%) - good ordinal agreement
- **Use for**: When capturing high-risk cases is the top priority

**Percentage Conversion Formula**
```
Percentage = Decimal Value × 100
Example: 0.6829 × 100 = 68.29%
```

### Current Model Performance

After running the pipeline, you'll see evaluation metrics for all 6 models:

```
Logistic Regression:
  Exact-Match Accuracy: 0.4950, QWK: 0.6604, Within-One: 0.9067, Macro F2: 0.5241

Random Forest:
  Exact-Match Accuracy: 0.5217, QWK: 0.6481, Within-One: 0.9483, Macro F2: 0.5081

Ordinal Logistic Regression:
  Exact-Match Accuracy: 0.5067, QWK: 0.6829, Within-One: 0.9617, Macro F2: 0.5082

XGBoost:
  Exact-Match Accuracy: 0.4900, QWK: 0.6239, Within-One: 0.9283, Macro F2: 0.4904

SVM (RBF Kernel):
  Exact-Match Accuracy: 0.4933, QWK: 0.6317, Within-One: 0.9483, Macro F2: 0.4779

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):
  Exact-Match Accuracy: 0.4117, QWK: 0.4948, Within-One: 0.8833, Macro F2: 0.4071
```

### Model Prediction Formulas

Each model uses a different mathematical approach to generate predictions:

**Logistic Regression:**
```
P(Y=k|X) = softmax(β_k · X + b_k)
Prediction: argmax_k P(Y=k|X)
```

**Random Forest:**
```
Prediction: majority_vote{f_t(X) for t in 1..500}
Probability: (votes_for_class_k) / 500
```

**Ordinal Logistic Regression:**
```
P(Y ≤ k|X) = σ(θ_k - β·X) where σ(z) = 1/(1+e^(-z))
P(Y=k|X) = P(Y ≤ k|X) - P(Y ≤ k-1|X)
```

**XGBoost:**
```
ŷ = Σ f_t(X) where f_t are gradient-boosted trees
P(Y=k|X) = softmax(ŷ_k) = exp(ŷ_k) / Σ_j exp(ŷ_j)
```

**SVM (RBF Kernel):**
```
f(x) = Σ α_i y_i K(x_i, x) + b
K(x_i, x) = exp(-γ ||x_i - x||^2)
Probability: Platt scaling applied to decision function
```

### Probability to Percentage Conversion

The API converts model probabilities from decimal (0.0-1.0) to percentage (0.0-100.0%) for user-friendly display:

```
percentage = round(probability × 100, 2)
```

Example:
- Raw probability: 0.452
- Displayed percentage: 45.2%

**Important Distinction: Overall Metrics vs. Single Prediction Probabilities**

There are two different percentage concepts in model evaluation:

**1. Overall Model Performance Metrics (Aggregate across test set):**
These metrics represent the model's overall accuracy across all 600 test samples. They are NOT the probability of a single prediction.

- **Accuracy (e.g., 52.17%):** Percentage of correct predictions out of 600 total predictions
  - Formula: `Accuracy = (Correct Predictions / Total Predictions) × 100`
  - Example: 313 correct out of 600 = 52.17%

- **Macro F1 (e.g., 50.8%):** Average of F1 scores across all 4 classes
  - Formula: `Macro F1 = (F1_Low + F1_Medium + F1_High + F1_Critical) / 4 × 100`

- **QWK (e.g., 68.3%):** Quadratic Weighted Kappa - ordinal agreement metric
  - Measures agreement between predicted and actual classes, weighted by ordinal distance

- **Within-one (e.g., 96.2%):** Percentage of predictions within one class of actual
  - Formula: `Within-one = (Predictions within ±1 class / Total Predictions) × 100`

**2. Single Prediction Probabilities (Per-sample class probabilities):**
For each individual project, the model outputs a probability distribution across the 4 risk levels. These are converted to percentages for user-friendly display.

- Formula: `Class_Percentage = round(Class_Probability × 100, 2)`
- Example for a single project:
  - Low: 0.15 → 15.00%
  - Medium: 0.45 → 45.00%
  - High: 0.30 → 30.00%
  - Critical: 0.10 → 10.00%
  - Sum: 100.00%

**Key Difference:**
- Overall metrics (50.7% accuracy) describe the model's performance across ALL test samples
- Single prediction percentages (15%, 45%, 30%, 10%) describe the confidence distribution for ONE specific project
